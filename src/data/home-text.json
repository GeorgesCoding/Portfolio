    "overview": "Hey there! I’m George Chen, an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, experienced with various programming languages and currently learning electrical hardware. I love challenging myself and broadening my knowledge of new technologies in building relevant projects to evaluate my understanding. Recently I delved into artificial intelligence by creating my chess engine and web development while designing a custom portfolio website, both completely new programming applications I self-taught myself. The next big project I wish to undertake will primarily focus on circuits and electrical systems, something I want to concentrate on as I progress further in my academic career. Some personal interests that are non-technology related are dragon & lion dance, classical piano, mechanical keyboards and camping, all of which I've been doing for over ten years.",
    "plangroup": "My time at Plan Group began with Project ALICE, an initiative to help improve the productivity of CAD design by developing custom tools for designers. I developed 5 different optimization tools in C# for Revit design. Subsequently, I transitioned to help with quality inspection control for electrical floor plan layouts in Revit for Sick Kids Hospital. In total, I examined over 40 layouts across two buildings, aiding in a 70% reduction in completion time per layout. Lastly, I designed plumbing and electrical fixtures in Revit for TD Bank electrical floor plan layouts and helped fix faulty conduit placements.",
